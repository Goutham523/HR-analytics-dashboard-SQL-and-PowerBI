# HR-analytics-dashboard-SQL-and-PowerBI

Project:
A leading multinational corporation experiencing some puzzling trends in their employees turnover rates. They are expecting there must be a hidden factor for the valuable employee leaving. Here I am trying dig and to get a deep insight from HR Data and uncover the truth. Here I am using a combination of SQL and Power BI here.  MySQL for managing the data and Power BI used for visualizing the cleaned data after it went through SQL process.

Report :
From the above dashboards, we can clearly see that gender is not a factor for employee termination. And also found that factors such as age, working location and department of job are influencing the termination of the workers.
